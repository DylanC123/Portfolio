                <h3>Photoline - GreatUniHack 2024</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An application made using React, along with PrimeReact, for the front-end and Go for the back-end.
                        Photoline is an application which helps users capture memories during their life, in the same way as a photo album.
                        Users can add 'memories' which are added to their timeline as a node with a name and date.
                        The user can then click on the memory to expand it and see a description and any photos which have been uploaded to that specific memory.
                        However, often memories involve other people, so it has a friend feature. Each user has a unique code to be used for adding other users. When creating a memory the user can add selected friends to it. This memory will then appear on their timeline as well, allowing them to also add photos. Another small but very key feature of having private images as a user may want some photos to be added to the memory but not be seen by other users as it is personal.

                <h3>Evolution Simulation - A level coursework mark 70/70</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p>Made in Unity with C++ for A-level coursework, achieving full marks. Involved procedural generation of a random 3D map with water and terrain. It involved the life cycle of Rabbits with basic attributes - eating, drinking and reproduction - which evolved over time. This is a very basic form of AI, representing 'Survival of the Fittest', showing a real life example of a genetic algorithm.</p>

                </ul>

                <h3>Fitness Application</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p>Made in HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript. This application was created by a group of seven students, including myself. It helps users plan and achieve weekly fitness goals, along with providing them with basic stats. The concept involved using databases with a further aim of adding a Strava API in back-end development.</p>

                <h3>UCL Short Course in Data Science with R</h3>
                <ul><li><p>A national short course focused in R, in which I won the competition at the end. This used basic data analysis tech- niques, to check accuracy of programs using practice data. Then performing queries and predictions on a database and presenting the results in a graphical format for the user.</p></ul>
                </ul>
